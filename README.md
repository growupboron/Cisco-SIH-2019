# Security camera powered with Machine Learning for people detection for queue Data Analytics

# Background
Long lines at specific time ticketing windows and service counters at railway stations, bus stands, RTO offices, banks and more could lead to bad service experiences. On many occasions, lines are longer at a specific time of day but empty at other times. It would be very useful if real-time and historical queue length could be made available via a website or mobile app to the user and facility managers. This would, in the long term, help deliver better experiences and smarter cities.

# What we want
The key technical challenge to solve this problem is to identify persons in a specific area. Cisco Meraki camera with MV Sense utilizes a powerful onboard processor to analyze videos and, using Machine Learning algorithms, detects persons in a specific area. Cisco Meraki IoT ready camera can be used as a building block in your application.
